This To-Do List webpage was a project assigned during The Odin Project curriculum. The project directions can be found here: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-todo-list

This assignment allowed me to slow down and really put my learned skills to the test in a fun and functional way.

Some of the different HTML, CSS, and Javascript tools I used are as follows: 
-Favicon 
-Forms 
-Grid 
-Flexbox 
-Arrays 
-For loops 
-Modules 
-DOM manipulation 
-Form validation 
-Objects 
-Classes 
-Webpack

I was also exposed to some new concepts and tools that I haven't worked with previously: 
-Expandable display 
-Date logic 
-Edit functionality 
-Filtering functionality 
-localStorage 
-ESLint

Overall, this is the second project in a row that I feel like things have finally clicked when it comes to JavaScript. I am getting stumped way less often and am finding solutions much quicker. This project was a bit of a heavy-weight in that it utilized so many different concepts and tools. For this reason, my growth as a result of this project was substantial.
