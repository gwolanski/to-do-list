# to-do-list

This To-Do List webpage was a project assigned during The Odin Project curriculum. This assignment allowed me to slow down and really put my learned skills to the test in a fun and functional way. 

Some of the different HTML, CSS, and Javascript "tools" I used are as follows:
    -Favicon
    -Forms
    -Grid
    -Flexbox
    -Arrays
    -For loops
    -Modules
    -DOM manipulation
    -Form validation
    -Objects
    -Classes
    -Webpack

I was also exposed to some new concepts and tools that I haven't worked with previously:
    -Expandable display
    -Date logic
    -Edit functionality
    -Filtering functionality
    -localStorage


Overall, this is the second project in a row that I feel like things have finally "clicked" when it comes to Javascript. I am getting stumped way less often and am finding solutions much quicker.
